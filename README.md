# üìà RNN-Based Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a time series forecasting project using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to predict stock prices. It explores both **simple and advanced RNN architectures** (LSTM and GRU), and evaluates their performance on **single** and **multi-target** stock prediction tasks.

Developed as part of the **IIITB-UpGrad PG Diploma in Data Science** program.

## üß† Project Overview

This project aims to build deep learning models to forecast the closing price of stocks using historical data. Two core scenarios were considered:

1. **Single Stock Prediction** ‚Äì Predicting closing prices for a single stock (AMZN).
2. **Multi-Stock Prediction** ‚Äì Simultaneous prediction of multiple stock closing prices.

We implemented:
- Simple RNN models
- Advanced RNN models using **LSTM** and **GRU**
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

## üß† Key Insights and Observations

- **RNN architectures** perform strongly for time series forecasting with appropriate tuning.
- **LSTM** and **GRU** outperform simple RNNs in most scenarios due to better long-term memory handling.
- For **multi-stock prediction**, **GRU** models provided the best trade-off between performance and complexity.
- Increasing **window size and stride** improves sequence learning for multi-target scenarios but also increases training time.

## ‚úÖ Final Outcomes

- Accurate stock price prediction models with **R¬≤ scores > 0.98** for AMZN.
- Successfully implemented **multi-target** forecasting using advanced RNN models.
- Delivered scalable and tunable models for both individual and group stock price forecasting.
